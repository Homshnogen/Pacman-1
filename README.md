# Vaxman
Modification of open source pacman game in c++ for Forage task

Rule changes:

- Vaxman kills ghosts on contact
- Each ghost multiplies after 30 seconds
- Win by collecting all the dots before the ghosts multiply to 32 times their original number

I still believe 30 seconds is too long for ghosts to multiply, and I tested the game with different delays. 8-10 seconds seems a lot more fun, and provides challenge to the player while still allowing multiple play strategies.
